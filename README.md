## How to play

Battleships Game Overview ¸.·´¯`·.´¯`·.¸¸.·´¯`·.¸><(((º>

Grid Setup: A 10x10 grid holds 5 ships of varying lengths, placed randomly.
Ammunition: Use 25 bullets to target and destroy ships on the grid.
Shooting: Choose a grid location (e.g., C4) to fire a bullet.
Outcome Display: Shots' outcomes (hit or miss) are shown on the grid.
Ship Orientation: Ships don't place diagonally; a hit extends in 4 directions.
Victory Condition: Uncover all ship positions before running out of bullets.

    Legend:
    1. "." = water or empty space
    2. "O" = part of ship
    3. "X" = part of ship that was hit with bullet
    4. "#" = water that was shot with bullet, a miss because it hit no ship
